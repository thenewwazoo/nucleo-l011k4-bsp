NUCLEO-L011K4-BSP
=================

This crate implements a BSP for the [ST NUCLEO-L011K4](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-l011k4.html) development board. It is intended to ease development while relieving the programmer of tracking peripheral and pin combinations, as well as providing helper methods for instantiating peripherals.

An example of crate usage can be found in [`src/main.rs`](src/main.rs)

Requirements
------------

Building this (and the dependent crates) requires a [nightly compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustup.rs/blob/master/README.md#working-with-nightly-rust).
